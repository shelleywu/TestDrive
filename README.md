# TestDrive

This is a basic test drive on the two wheels of my robot's motors using Adafruit motor shields and Arduino (will specify on type later). 
I wanted to see if my motor shield and motors worked. Good thing that it worked. I didn't waste money.

TestDrive was used in my semiautonomous moving robot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu6evmJ-aMc
